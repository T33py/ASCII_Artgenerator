[WIP] Generate ascii art for an image based on the "currier new" font.
The reason why currier new is the font of choise is that it is both singlespaced (easier to program) and the default font for Notepad++ which is a great tool for viewing your generated art in its full splendour.

Input images specified with the "-i <name>.<extension>" argument will be read from the assets folder.
Output text files specified with the "-o <name>.<extension>" will be placed in the out folder .
